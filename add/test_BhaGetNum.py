Scenario 1: Verify the addition of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_positive_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers, such as 5 and 3.
  Act: Invoke the get_num function with these integers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the result equals the sum of the two integers (e.g., 8).
Validation:
  It is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the most basic and expected usage scenario, which is the addition of two positive integers.

Scenario 2: Verify the addition of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers, such as -5 and -3.
  Act: Invoke the get_num function with these integers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the result equals the sum of the two integers (e.g., -8).
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle negative integers, as these are valid inputs in Python.

Scenario 3: Verify the addition of a positive and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_positive_and_negative
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and a negative integer, such as 5 and -3.
  Act: Invoke the get_num function with these integers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the result equals the sum of the two integers (e.g., 2).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle mixed positive and negative integers.

Scenario 4: Verify the addition of zero and any integer
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_zero_and_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to add zero and any integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and any integer, such as 0 and 5.
  Act: Invoke the get_num function with these as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the result equals the integer (e.g., 5).
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly implements the mathematical principle that adding zero to any number results in the same number.

Scenario 5: Verify the addition of two floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_get_num_floats
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to add two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating-point numbers, such as 1.5 and 2.5.
  Act: Invoke the get_num function with these as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the result equals the sum of the two floating-point numbers (e.g., 4.0).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle floating-point numbers, which are a common type of input in Python.
