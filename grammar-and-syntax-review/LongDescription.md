# Use AI to Review Your Content

The **Grammar and Syntax Review** app is a custom UI on top of LLMs for a special use case.

Any data scientist or Python developer could build a similar app using open source H2O Wave and H2OGPT!

Marketing users and content writers, especially those with English as a 
second language, can use this app to review their content and ensure it meets 
the brand standards. 

Ways that Python developers could easily customize this app:
* Change the theme and logo to match your company
* Change the details in the prompt to match your company, for example, we use Title Case and the Oxford Comma
* Change the complete use case - this template could become an app which helps you meal plan
