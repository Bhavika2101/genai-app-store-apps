  'text': "Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Mickey, and good afternoon. I would like to first congratulate Mickey on his upcoming retirement. He has led our investor relations team for nearly 18 years spanning 70 earnings calls and, after tomorrow, 18 annual meetings. He will be missed by all and especially this audience. And we thank him for his outstanding service to FedEx over the years.\xa0And we also take this opportunity to welcome John Dietrich, our chief financial officer for FedEx. With more than 30 years of experience in the aviation and air cargo industries, John brings a unique blend of financial and operational expertise to our leadership team at a very important time for this company.\xa0He's already hit the ground running, and I'm very happy that he has joined FedEx. So, now turning to the quarter. We entered fiscal year '24 with strength and momentum, delivering results ahead of expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. I'm proud of what the FedEx team has accomplished over the last 12 months. Amid significant demand disruption, we delivered on what we said we would do, driving over $2 billion in year-over-year cost savings in fiscal '23. We are now well advanced in executing on that transmission to be the most efficient, flexible, and intelligent global network. Our first-quarter progress gives me great conviction in our ability to execute going forward.\xa0We came into the quarter determined to provide excellent service to our customers despite the industry dynamics. We achieved that goal while delivering innovative and data-driven solutions that further enhance the customer experience. As a result, we are well positioned as we prepare for the peak season.\xa0As you can see in our results on Slide 6, our transformation is enhancing our profitability. Ground was a bright spot with higher revenue year over year driven by higher yields. On top of this growth, Ground drove exceptional operational performance, leading to its most profitable quarter ever on an adjusted basis.\xa0As expected, total revenue declined as volumes and yields were pressured at Express and Freight . We indicated last quarter that Express revenue would be adversely impacted by international export yield pressure, as well as a change in strategy by the US Postal Service which we are addressing through DRIVE as we build a more nimble airline. For\xa0the total company, we delivered 200 basis points of adjusted margin improvement as we realized efficiencies across our networks. This performance is a testament to the power of DRIVE and the FedEx team working collaboratively to implement structural cost reductions throughout the enterprise. During the quarter, labor negotiations at our primary competitor and the bankruptcy of Yellow disrupted the market.\xa0Our priorities were clear: protect our customers, deliver outstanding service, and focus on high-quality revenue. We delivered on those priorities, leveraging our flexible network to profitably add volume while maintaining the highest levels of service. While the captured upside as a result of these one-time events, we were highly discerning in terms of the business we accepted in keeping with our goal to drive high-quality revenue.\xa0Importantly, we expect to maintain the majority of the volume we added in the quarter. I want to thank our FedEx team for deftly navigating these conditions to execute on our disciplined strategy. Now turning to DRIVE. We are fundamentally changing the way we work, drivers taking cost out of our network, and we are on track to deliver our targeted $1.8 billion in structural benefits from DRIVE this fiscal year.\xa0At Ground, our DRIVE initiatives reduced costs by $130 million this quarter. These savings were primarily driven by lower third-party transportation rates as a result of a newly implemented purchase bid system, as well as optimized rail usage, the continued benefit from reduced Sunday coverage, and the consolidation of source.\xa0At Freight, we continue to manage our cost base more effectively. For example, during the quarter, Freight completed the planned closure of 29 terminal locations during August. And at Express, despite headwinds from Asia yields and the US Postal Service, we delivered on our plan. We're making our global network more efficient primarily through structural flight takedowns and efficiencies at our hubs and source as we rightsize the capacity across the network. In Europe, DRIVE initiatives are on track, and we expect them to gain further traction over the course of the year and into FY '25. Looking ahead, we're excited to leverage John's aviation experience as we continue to transform our air network. Our\xa0DRIVE expectations for this year include the G&A savings we have previously outlined, which we believe will start to ramp in the second half of this fiscal year. Finally, on Slide 8, I will provide a brief update on our key strategic focus areas as we move into the next phase of our transformation.\xa0This includes One FedEx, which is how we are better aligning our organization to enable Network 2.0. We are well underway with plans to simplify our organization. In June 2024, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services will consolidate into one company, Federal Express Corporation. The reorganization will reduce and optimize overhead, streamline our go-to-market capabilities, and improve the customer experience. To date, we have implemented or announced Network 2.0 in several markets including Alaska, Hawaii, and Canada. As each market is different, we're continuously learning and tailoring the network to adapt to the operational characteristics unique to each region while delivering the highest-quality service for our customers.\xa0We continue to use both employee couriers and service providers for pickup and delivery operations across the network. As with any significant transformation, these changes are being thoughtfully executed and will take time to complete. The network that FedEx has built over the last 50 years provides us a foundation that is unmatched.\xa0This physical network enables us to transport millions of packages a day around the world, generating terabytes of data that contain invaluable insights about the global supply chain. We are focused on harnessing the power of this rich data to make supply chains smarter for everyone, for our customers, for our customers' customers, and for ourselves. As we move to the next phase of our transformation, I've given the team three specific challenges: to use data to make our network more efficient, make our customer experiences better, and drive new profitable revenue streams through digital. Looking ahead to the rest of FY '24. We remain focused on delivering the highest-quality service and aggressively managing what is within our control.\xa0Factoring in better-than-expected first-quarter results, we're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS outlook range. As we continue to deliver on our commitments, I'm confident we have the right strategy and the right team in place to create significant value. With that, let me turn the call over to Brie.",

  'text': "Brie Carere -- Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer: Thank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter, we remain focused on revenue quality and being a valued partner to our customers. We did this in an operating environment marked by continued but moderating volume pressure, mixed yield dynamics, and unique developments in the competitive landscape. Let's take each segment in turn. At FedEx Ground, first-quarter revenue was up 3% year over year driven by a 1% increase in volume and 3% increase in yield. Revenue at FedEx Express was down 9% year over year. Volume remained pressured though total Express volume declines moderated sequentially. International export package volumes were up 3% year over year.\xa0Similar to the fourth quarter, parcel volume declines were most pronounced in the United States. Additionally, U.S. freight pounds were down 27%, continuing the trend we mentioned last quarter tied to the change in strategy by the United States Postal Service. Across the Ground and Express, volumes improved sequentially, aided by the threat of a strike at our primary competitor.\xa0We onboarded new customers who valued our service and were committed to a long-term partnership with FedEx. As a result, we added approximately 400,000 in average daily volume by the end of the first quarter, and the team did an excellent job focusing on commercial Ground business acquisition. At FedEx Freight, revenue was down 16% driven by a 13% decline in volume.\xa0We experienced significant improvement in volume in August due to Yellow's closure. Freight benefited from approximately 5,000 incremental average daily shipments at attractive rates as we exited the quarter. As you can see on Slide 11, monthly volumes have improved sequentially with Ground and international export volumes inflecting positively on a year-over-year basis.\xa0We expect to continue benefiting from this quarter's market share gains throughout the fiscal year. We anticipate improved year-over-year growth rates, especially late in the fiscal year, albeit within a muted demand environment. The old trends we shared last quarter persisted, particularly at FedEx Express where we saw reduced fuel and demand surcharges year over year.\xa0Product mix shifts, including an increase in e-commerce volume and demand for our international economy service after the May reopening in AMEA, also put pressure on yield growth. At FedEx Ground, we saw better than expected yields as a result of higher weight for package and product mix. At FedEx Freight, base rates were strong despite lower weights.\xa0The revenue per shipment year-over-year decline was due to lower fuel surcharges. Now looking ahead to peak. We recently announced demand surcharges for the holiday shopping season to stay well positioned relative to market. We also announced a 5.9% general rate increase effective this coming January. This average annual increase, one point below last year's rate, reflects the current cost and market environment, along with the investment we need to serve customers effectively. We had a high capture rate for our GRI in FY '23 and believe this year's increase will ensure that continues. We continue to find new revenue-quality opportunities. In 2024, we will implement technology changes to increase our capture of package dimensions in several markets outside of the United States.\xa0Further, we are updating our dimensional pricing to market practice in Europe, moving from per shipment to a per-piece strategy. Moving to Slide 13. I was very pleased with our service levels around the world. I'm proud of how our team delivered here in the United States as we added volume late in the quarter.\xa0We are also building momentum in Europe. We improved service year over year in the region, and as a result, the Europe team was able to win back market share that we lost due to previous service challenges. There's still work to do, but our service improvements are also leading to better financial performance\xa0Europe -- in Europe with much more to come. As Raj stated, we have a vision to make supply chain smarter for everyone, and I have a few examples of how our digital infrastructure is enabling new capabilities for our customers. We are improving the customer experience through technology with recent investment in Salesforce Data Cloud.\xa0We will integrate three customer platforms: customer service, marketing, and sales into one, giving the customer a more informed, efficient, and personalized experience when doing business with FedEx. We are now offering our estimated delivery time window, which provides customers with a four-hour window for their package delivery for 96% of inbound volume globally across 48 countries. This growing capability is nicely complemented by picture proof of delivery or, as we like to say, PPOD, which is expanded across Europe in the first quarter. Now available in 53 markets, PPOD provides shippers with increased confidence in package delivery and helps reduce the volume of customer calls and claims.\xa0One FedEx and Network 2.0 will simplify how we do business, which is particularly important for our small and medium customers. For example, our current customer contracts reflect three independent companies. One FedEx will enable us to change that, making doing business with FedEx and becoming a new customer easier.\xa0Network 2.0 will be more efficient for FedEx but also more efficient for our customers. When we integrate a market with one truck in one neighborhood that's not just for deliveries, it also means a streamlined pickup experience, one pickup per day versus two. This is a simple but very impactful change, and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.\xa0Small and medium businesses are a high-value growth segment, and we are confident that the improvements underway will further enable share gains. And lastly, we've expanded My FedEx Rewards beyond the United States into nearly 30 other countries, with nine more European countries to launch later this year.\xa0My FedEx Rewards is the only loyalty program in the industry and benefits our customers by providing them with rewards they can invest in back into their business. They can use them to recognize their employees for a job well done or give back to their communities. My FedEx Rewards have been a successful program in the United States, and we've built lasting relationships as we continue to invest in our customers.\xa0We are excited about the potential to replicate this success in Europe and around the world. Driving to anticipate customers' needs and provide them with superior service is deeply embedded in our FedEx culture. I'm proud of how our teams work together to support our current customers, build relationships with new ones, and ensure that FedEx is\xa0positioned to succeed during the quarter.\xa0Now, I will turn it over to John to discuss the financials in more detail.",

One FedEx will enable us to change that, making doing business with FedEx and becoming a new customer easier.\xa0Network 2.0 will be more efficient for FedEx but also more efficient for our customers. When we integrate a market with one truck in one neighborhood that's not just for deliveries, it also means a streamlined pickup experience, one pickup per day versus two. This is a simple but very impactful change, and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.\xa0Small and medium businesses are a high-value growth segment, and we are confident that the improvements underway will further enable share gains.</p> <p>And lastly, we've expanded My FedEx Rewards beyond the United States into nearly 30 other countries, with nine more European countries to launch later this year.\xa0My FedEx Rewards is the only loyalty program in the industry and benefits our customers by providing them with rewards they can invest in back into their business. They can use them to recognize their employees for a job well done or give back to their communities. My FedEx Rewards have been a successful program in the United States, and we've built lasting relationships as we continue to invest in our customers.\xa0We are excited about the potential to replicate this success in Europe and around the world. Driving to anticipate customers' needs and provide them with superior service is deeply embedded in our FedEx culture.</p> <p>I'm proud of how our teams work together to support our current customers, build relationships with new ones, and ensure that FedEx is\xa0positioned to succeed during the quarter.\xa0Now, I will turn it over to John to discuss the financials in more detail.</p>"},

  'text': "John Dietrich -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to be here. It's been a full sprint these last few weeks as I continue to get up to speed with this great company. As some of you may know, I've done business with FedEx throughout my career. Through that experience, I've always admired how FedEx literally created a new industry and has built a differentiated network that serves customers all over the world.\xa0I've also admired its great culture that has thrived through the people-service-profit, or PSP, philosophy. After only being here a few short weeks, I've seen the incredible opportunity we have before us. Not only will we continue to provide our customers with the best service and product offerings, but our plans to bring our businesses together through One FedEx and execute on DRIVE and Network 2.0 initiatives will be truly transformative.\xa0These initiatives will leverage and optimize everything that the talented teams across FedEx have built over the last 50 years. It will make us smarter; it will make us more efficient; and it will enable us to serve our customers better. Before getting into the numbers, I want to share a brief overview of the priorities that will guide me and the finance organization as we move forward.\xa0First and foremost, I'm committed to setting stringent financial goals that reflect the significant opportunity we have to improve margins and returns. This will be enabled by the DRIVE initiatives and the integration of Network 2.0 as we move toward One FedEx. I've been really impressed by the tremendous amount of work already completed on DRIVE from the initiatives in place, the accountability embedded in the program, and the team's steadfast focus on execution.\xa0In terms of our capital priorities, I'll focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders, and reinvesting in the business with a focus on the highest returns. Our finance organization will partner closely with Raj and the leadership team to ensure we deliver consistent progress toward these priorities with the goal of delivering significant value for our employees, partners, customers, and shareholders in the years to come.\xa0Finally, a guiding principle for me will be to have open and transparent communication with all key stakeholders, including all of you in the financial community. I already know some of you from my prior roles. I look forward to continuing to work together and engaging with the rest of you in the weeks and months ahead.\xa0Now taking a closer look at our results. Our fiscal year 2024 is off to an outstanding start as demonstrated by the strong operational execution in the first quarter. At FedEx Ground, DRIVE initiatives are taking hold, and we delivered the most profitable quarter in our history for that segment on an adjusted basis.\xa0Adjusted operating income at Ground was up 61%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 480 basis points to 13.3%. These strong results were driven by yield improvement and cost reductions, including lower line haul expense and improved first and last-mile productivity. As a result, cost per package was down more than 2%. At FedEx Express, the business was able to improve operating income despite a decline in revenue.\xa0This further demonstrates that DRIVE is working. Adjusted operating income at Express was up 14%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 2.1%. Cost reductions and transformation efforts at FedEx Express included structural flight reductions, alignment of staffing with volume levels, parking aircraft, and shifting to one delivery wave per day in the U.S., all of which more than offset the impact of lower revenue.\xa0It's important to note that expanding operating margins and reducing costs at Express will be a key focus for me and the team. At FedEx Freight, the team diligently managed costs and revenue quality amid a dynamic volume environment. Operating margin declined 290 basis points based on lower fuel surcharges and shipments but remained strong at 21%. Now turning to our fiscal year outlook on Slide 17. As we've been discussing, we're beginning to see the benefits of our DRIVE initiatives and our focus on improved revenue quality.\xa0Based on our solid first-quarter performance and our view of the rest of the year, we're raising the low end of our full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.50. We're now expecting adjusted EPS in the range of $17 to $18.50. We're confident we can deliver on this higher earnings outlook despite the constrained demand environment.\xa0We're now assuming revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint of our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EPS outlook range. Of course, an improvement in demand would translate into greater operating leverage and earnings upside, supporting the high end of our range. We'll be closely monitoring the demand environment going forward, including economic activity in North America, Europe, and Trans-Pacific trade. We'll also be keeping a close watch on other key factors that impact the demand environment, including inventory restocking, inflation, and e-commerce trends. Turning to Slide 18. And consistent with last quarter, we want to share how we're thinking about the operating profit considerations embedded in our full-year outlook.\xa0For illustration purposes, we used adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion, which is the equivalent of the adjusted EPS midpoint of $17.75. Within this outlook, we're highlighting a few key assumptions. Revenue, net of cost increases, is now expected to be up $500 million due to improved revenue quality and flow-through at Ground.\xa0We continue to expect approximately $800 million of international export yield pressure as demand surcharges significantly diminish and service mix continues shifting toward deferred offerings. As a result of our strong first-quarter performance, we're also planning for a $600 million increase in variable compensation.\xa0These headwinds are more than offset by the $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from our DRIVE initiatives, which we shared with you last quarter and are on track to achieve. Moving on to Slide 19. We remain steadfast in our commitment to prudent capital allocation and shareholder returns. Our liquidity position remained strong, and we ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash.\xa0Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.3 billion, and we continue to expect to achieve our target of less than 6.5% capex to revenue for the year. Our capital expenditures at Ground will decline as we reduce capacity investment. And we're planning for lower annual aircraft capex over time, which we expect to be approximately $1 billion in fiscal year '26. As we've previously communicated, we're standing behind our commitment to capital discipline by tying executive compensation to ROIC. Given improved earnings, we're generating significant and improved cash flow.\xa0This is supporting our ability to enhance shareholder returns, demonstrated by the completion of our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion in common stock this fiscal year while we're also paying our dividend. With that, let's open it up for questions.",
  'defensiveness': {'Rating': 2,
   'Reason for Rating': "The response is somewhat defensive because John Dietrich, the Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, emphasizes the company's achievements and prospects in his opening statement, implying that he is trying to convince the audience of FedEx's strengths and prospects for growth. He also highlights the company's dedication to 'prudent capital allocation' and 'shareholder returns,' indicating a focus on maintaining investor confidence. Throughout the presentation, he continues to show optimism about FedEx's future, citing initiatives like DRIVE and Network 2.0, which are expected to improve margins and returns. While there are some acknowledgments of challenges such as volume pressure and yield dynamics, the overall tone remains positive. Therefore, the rating is 2, indicating a somewhat defensive stance."},
