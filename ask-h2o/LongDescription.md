# Ask Questions About H2O

The **Ask H2O** app is a custom UI on top of H2O Documentation and LLMs for a special use case.
Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, users can ask questions and get contextualized answers from public H2O documentation.

Any data scientist or Python developer could build a similar app using open source H2O Wave and H2OGPTE!

Ways that Python developers could easily customize this app:
* Change the theme and logo to match your company
* Change the collection of documents available to end users
