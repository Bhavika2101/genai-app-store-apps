Scenario 1: Validate Dropdown Population
Details:
  TestName: test_dropdown_population
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the dropdown is populated correctly with the collections of documents.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with a set of collections in q.app.collections.
  Act: Invoke the selected_collection function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the dropdown in q.page['collection'] and q.page['collection-mobile'] contains the same collections as in q.app.collections.
Validation:
  This test ensures that all available collections are correctly presented to the user in the dropdown, which is crucial for the user to be able to select the desired collection.

Scenario 2: Validate Topic Generation
Details:
  TestName: test_topic_generation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that topics are correctly generated based on the selected collection.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with a selected collection in q.client.selected_collection and an instance of H2OGPTE in q.app.h2ogpte.
  Act: Invoke the selected_collection function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that topics are generated and stored in q.client.topic_response.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly generates topics based on the selected collection, which is a key part of the function's purpose.

Scenario 3: Validate Topic Table Population
Details:
  TestName: test_topic_table_population
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the table of topics is populated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with a topic response in q.client.topic_response.
  Act: Invoke the selected_collection function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the table in q.page['collection'] contains the same topics as in q.client.topic_response.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the generated topics are correctly presented to the user in the table, which is crucial for the user to be able to see the topics.

Scenario 4: Validate Waiting Dialog Display
Details:
  TestName: test_waiting_dialog_display
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the waiting dialog is displayed while topics are being generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with all necessary properties.
  Act: Invoke the selected_collection function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the waiting dialog is displayed during topic generation.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the user is properly informed about the ongoing process, which is important for good user experience.

Scenario 5: Validate Error Handling when Collection Does Not Exist
Details:
  TestName: test_nonexistent_collection_error_handling
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles the case where the selected collection does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with a non-existent collection in q.client.selected_collection.
  Act: Invoke the selected_collection function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate error is logged or handled.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle error scenarios gracefully, which is important for robustness and reliability.
