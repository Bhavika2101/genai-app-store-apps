================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The environment variable 'HEAP_ID' is accessed without prior validation. This could potentially lead to exposure of sensitive information if the environment is not properly secured.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize environment variables before use. If 'HEAP_ID' is not present, the function should throw an exception or error.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The hashlib.sha256 function is being used to hash user ids. While SHA-256 is not currently broken, it is recommended to use a more secure, non-reversible method for storing or identifying user data.
Solution: Consider using a more secure hash function or a method that includes a salt, such as bcrypt, to protect user data.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The event_properties variable is directly inserted into the script without any form of sanitization or escaping. This could potentially lead to JavaScript or SQL injection attacks if the variable contains malicious input.
Solution: Always sanitize and escape user input before inserting it into a script. Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when HEAP_ID is not in os.environ
Details:
  TestName: test_heap_id_not_in_environment
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns None when HEAP_ID is not in os.environ.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure HEAP_ID is not in os.environ.
  Act: Invoke the function with arbitrary userid and event_properties.
  Assert: Check that the function returns None.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when HEAP_ID is not available in the environment variables. It should return None in such a case, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Test when userid is None
Details:
  TestName: test_userid_is_none
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function does not append any identity-related script when the userid is None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure HEAP_ID is in os.environ. Set userid to None.
  Act: Invoke the function with None userid and arbitrary event_properties.
  Assert: Check that the returned script does not contain any identity-related portions ("heap.identify").
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function does not unnecessarily identify non-logged in users (userid=None). This is a key aspect of the function's business logic.

Scenario 3: Test when userid is not None
Details:
  TestName: test_userid_is_not_none
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly appends an identity-related script when the userid is not None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure HEAP_ID is in os.environ. Set userid to a non-null value.
  Act: Invoke the function with non-null userid and arbitrary event_properties.
  Assert: Check that the returned script contains "heap.identify" with the hashed userid.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies logged-in users by appending the appropriate script. It's a critical part of the function's business logic.

Scenario 4: Test when event_properties is None
Details:
  TestName: test_event_properties_is_none
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function does not append any event properties-related script when event_properties is None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure HEAP_ID is in os.environ. Set event_properties to None.
  Act: Invoke the function with arbitrary userid and None event_properties.
  Assert: Check that the returned script does not contain any event properties-related portions ("heap.addEventProperties").
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not add unnecessary event properties when none are provided. This is a key aspect of the function's business logic.

Scenario 5: Test when event_properties is not None
Details:
  TestName: test_event_properties_is_not_none
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly appends an event properties-related script when the event_properties is not None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure HEAP_ID is in os.environ. Set event_properties to a non-null value.
  Act: Invoke the function with arbitrary userid and non-null event_properties.
  Assert: Check that the returned script contains "heap.addEventProperties" with the provided event_properties.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly adds provided event properties by appending the appropriate script. This is a critical part of the function's business logic.
