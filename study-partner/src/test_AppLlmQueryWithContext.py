================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code logs errors without sanitization or restriction, potentially exposing sensitive information such as system details or API keys.
Solution: Ensure that only necessary information is logged. Sanitize error messages to remove sensitive data before logging, or use a logging level that does not include potentially sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The code appears to use hard-coded credentials (address and api_key) to establish a connection. This could expose these credentials if the code is publicly accessible or otherwise leaked.
Solution: Remove hard-coded credentials and use a secure method to handle credentials, such as environment variables or a secure vault service.

Vulnerability: CWE-730: OWASP Top Ten 2021 Category A3:2021 - Injection
Issue: The code passes user inputs (user_message) directly to the query function without sanitization, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
Solution: Sanitize user inputs before using them in function calls or database queries. Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid injection.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test successful query with valid parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_llm_query_with_context_successful_query
  Description: This test is intended to validate the successful query execution when valid parameters are passed to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the H2OGPTE object and its methods. Prepare valid connection_details, collection_id, and user_message parameters.
  Act: Call the llm_query_with_context method with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected response.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the main functionality of the method works as expected when provided with valid parameters.

Scenario 2: Test query execution with invalid connection details
Details:
  TestName: test_llm_query_with_context_invalid_connection
  Description: This test is designed to validate the function's behavior when invalid connection details are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the H2OGPTE object and its methods. Prepare invalid connection_details, and valid collection_id, and user_message parameters.
  Act: Call the llm_query_with_context method with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the method handles invalid connection details gracefully and doesn't crash the entire application.

Scenario 3: Test query execution with invalid collection id
Details:
  TestName: test_llm_query_with_context_invalid_collection_id
  Description: This test is designed to validate the function's behavior when an invalid collection id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the H2OGPTE object and its methods. Prepare valid connection_details, invalid collection_id, and valid user_message parameters.
  Act: Call the llm_query_with_context method with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to validate the function's behavior when it is provided with an invalid collection id. The function should handle this gracefully.

Scenario 4: Test query execution with empty user message
Details:
  TestName: test_llm_query_with_context_empty_user_message
  Description: This test is designed to validate the function's behavior when an empty user message is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the H2OGPTE object and its methods. Prepare valid connection_details, collection_id, and empty user_message parameters.
  Act: Call the llm_query_with_context method with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to validate the function's behavior when it is provided with an empty user message. The function should handle this gracefully.

Scenario 5: Test query execution when an exception is raised
Details:
  TestName: test_llm_query_with_context_exception_handling
  Description: This test is designed to validate the function's exception handling mechanism.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the H2OGPTE object and its methods to raise an exception when called. Prepare valid connection_details, collection_id, and user_message parameters.
  Act: Call the llm_query_with_context method with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can handle unexpected exceptions gracefully without crashing the entire application.
