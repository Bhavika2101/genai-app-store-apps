```
Scenario 1: Validate the returned ui.chatbot_card object
Details:
  TestName: test_chatbot_card_return_object
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function chatbot_card returns an object of type ui.chatbot_card.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the chatbot_card function and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of ui.chatbot_card.
Validation:
  This test is important because the function is expected to return a ui.chatbot_card object. If it doesn't, it indicates a problem with the function's implementation.

Scenario 2: Validate the properties of the returned ui.chatbot_card object
Details:
  TestName: test_chatbot_card_object_properties
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the properties of the returned ui.chatbot_card object are as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the chatbot_card function and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check that the properties of the returned object match the expected values (box is "chat", data is a list with 'content from_user', name is 'chatbot', and placeholder is "What is your answer?").
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function correctly initializes a ui.chatbot_card object with the expected properties.

Scenario 3: Verify the chatbot_card function does not modify any global state
Details:
  TestName: test_chatbot_card_global_state
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the chatbot_card function does not modify any global state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the global state before invoking the function.
  Act: Invoke the chatbot_card function.
  Assert: Compare the global state before and after invoking the function to ensure it has not been modified.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because functions should generally avoid modifying global state, as it can lead to unpredictable behavior and hard-to-diagnose bugs.

Scenario 4: Verify the chatbot_card function is idempotent
Details:
  TestName: test_chatbot_card_idempotency
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the chatbot_card function is idempotent, i.e., invoking it multiple times with the same inputs yields the same output each time.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the chatbot_card function multiple times and store the returned objects.
  Assert: Check that all returned objects are equal.
Validation:
  This test is important because if the function is not idempotent, it could lead to unexpected behavior, especially in larger systems where it might be invoked multiple times.
