================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code imports 'os' module which can be used for directory traversal attacks if not used properly. In the given code, there's no direct vulnerability but the usage of 'os' module can lead to issues if misused.
Solution: Avoid using 'os' module for file operations if possible. If you must use it, ensure to validate and sanitize all inputs that will be used as file paths. Use os.path.realpath() or os.path.abspath() to validate paths.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: Again related to 'os' module, some functions such as 'os.system()' can be dangerous if used improperly, leading to command injection vulnerabilities. The provided code doesn't use these functions but care should be taken in future development.
Solution: Avoid using functions that can execute system commands or can interact with the file system directly. If it's necessary, always sanitize and validate inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: If the data used in 'ui.chatbot_card()' comes from user inputs or is not properly sanitized, it could lead to log injection issues.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate any data that will be logged. Avoid logging sensitive information.
