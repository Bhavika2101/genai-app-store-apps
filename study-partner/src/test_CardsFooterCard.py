Scenario 1: Validating the Box Parameter in the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_box_parameter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer card's box parameter is correctly set to "footer".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the box attribute of the returned footer_card object is set to "footer".
Validation:
  The box parameter is a crucial aspect of the footer card's functionality as it determines where the card will be displayed. Ensuring it is correctly set guarantees the footer card will be displayed at the desired location.

Scenario 2: Validating the Caption Parameter in the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_caption_parameter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer card's caption parameter is correctly set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the caption attribute of the returned footer_card object is set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.".
Validation:
  The caption parameter is essential for providing information about the footer card. Ensuring it is correctly set guarantees that the correct information will be displayed on the footer card.

Scenario 3: Validating the Type of the Returned Object
Details:
  TestName: test_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer_card() function returns an object of type ui.footer_card.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of ui.footer_card.
Validation:
  It's crucial to ensure that the function returns the expected type of object. If it does not, it could lead to type errors or incorrect behavior in other parts of the application that use this function.
