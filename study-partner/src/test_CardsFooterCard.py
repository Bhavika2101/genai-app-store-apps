Scenario 1: Validate the box value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'box' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'footer'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'box' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'footer'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'box' attribute is crucial for the correct positioning of the footer card on the UI. This test ensures that the footer card always appears at the correct location.

Scenario 2: Validate the caption value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'caption' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'caption' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'caption' attribute is essential for displaying the correct message on the footer card. This test ensures that the footer card always shows the correct message.

Scenario 3: Validate the type of object returned by the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the object returned by the footer card function is of the type ui.footer_card.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check if the type of the returned object is ui.footer_card.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Ensuring the type of the returned object is crucial to avoid type errors when using the object. This test ensures that the function always returns an object of the correct type.
