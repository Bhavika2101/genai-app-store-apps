Scenario 1: Testing if the function footer_card returns a footer card with the correct caption
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption
  Description: The test is intended to verify whether the function footer_card returns a footer card with the correct caption "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave."
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card.
  Assert: Check whether the return value's caption attribute matches the string "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave."
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the footer card is being created with the correct caption. This is a key part of the function's specification and essential for the correct display of the footer card.

Scenario 2: Testing if the function footer_card returns a footer card with the correct box
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box
  Description: The test is intended to verify whether the function footer_card returns a footer card with the correct box "footer."
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card.
  Assert: Check whether the return value's box attribute matches the string "footer."
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function footer_card correctly assigns the box attribute to the returned footer card. This attribute is significant because it determines the footer card's location on the page, and as per the function's specification, it should be "footer."

Scenario 3: Testing if the function footer_card returns a footer card of the correct type
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_type
  Description: The test is intended to verify whether the function footer_card returns an object of the correct type ui.footer_card.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card.
  Assert: Check whether the return value is an instance of ui.footer_card.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function footer_card returns a footer card of the correct type. This is crucial because the type of the returned object determines what operations can be performed on it and how it behaves. This is a fundamental part of the function's specification.
