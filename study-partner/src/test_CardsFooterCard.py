Scenario 1: Validating the Box Property in the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_box_property
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the box property in the footer card is set to "footer". This is an essential aspect of the business logic as it ensures the footer card is correctly positioned in the user interface. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function footer_card.
  Act: Call the function footer_card and store the returned card object.
  Assert: Check if the box property of the card object is set to "footer".
Validation:
  Rationale: The box property determines the position of the card in the user interface. It is crucial to check this to ensure the footer card appears in the right place. A wrong box property could lead to misplacement of the footer card in the user interface.

Scenario 2: Validating the Caption Property in the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_caption_property
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the caption property in the footer card is set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.". This is a crucial aspect of the business logic as it ensures the footer card displays the correct text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function footer_card.
  Act: Call the function footer_card and store the returned card object.
  Assert: Check if the caption property of the card object is set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.".
Validation:
  Rationale: The caption property determines the text that is displayed in the footer card. It is important to check this to ensure the footer card displays the correct text. Incorrect captions could lead to confusion for the users.

Scenario 3: Validating the Type of the Returned Object
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_returned_object_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer_card function returns an object of type ui.footer_card. This is important to ensure that the function is returning an object of the correct type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function footer_card.
  Act: Call the function footer_card and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of ui.footer_card.
Validation:
  Rationale: It is crucial to ensure that the function returns an object of the correct type. If the return type is incorrect, it could lead to errors when trying to use properties or methods specific to the ui.footer_card type.
