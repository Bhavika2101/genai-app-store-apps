```
Scenario 1: Validate the box value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'box' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'footer'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'box' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'footer'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'box' attribute is a crucial part of the footer_card function. It determines the placement of the footer card on the page. Thus, it's important to ensure the function sets this attribute correctly.

Scenario 2: Validate the caption value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'caption' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'caption' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'caption' attribute provides a message to the user. It's important to ensure that this message is set correctly by the function, as it directly impacts the user experience.

Scenario 3: Test the footer_card function for the correct type of object returned
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the type of the object returned by the footer_card function is 'ui.footer_card'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check if the type of the returned object is 'ui.footer_card'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The function is expected to return a 'ui.footer_card' object. This test ensures that the function is returning the correct type of object.
