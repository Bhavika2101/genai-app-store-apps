```
Scenario 1: Validate the box value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'box' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'footer'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check the 'box' value of the returned footer_card object. It should be 'footer'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'box' value is a crucial part of the footer_card function. It determines the placement of the footer card on the page. Thus, it's important to ensure the function sets the correct box value.

Scenario 2: Validate the caption value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'caption' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check the 'caption' value of the returned footer_card object. It should be 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'caption' value is an important part of the footer card as it displays the text in the footer. Thus, ensuring the function sets the correct caption value is crucial.

Scenario 3: Validate the type of the returned object of the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the returned object of the footer_card function is of the type 'ui.footer_card'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check the type of the returned footer_card object. It should be 'ui.footer_card'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: It's important to ensure that the function returns an object of the correct type to ensure compatibility with other functions or methods that may use the returned object.
