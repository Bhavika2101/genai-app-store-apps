```
Scenario 1: Validate the box value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'box' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'footer'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'box' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'footer'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'box' attribute is a crucial part of the footer_card function. It determines the placement of the footer card on the page. Thus, it's important to ensure the function sets it correctly.

Scenario 2: Validate the caption in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'caption' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'caption' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'caption' attribute provides the text that would be displayed on the footer card. This test ensures that the function sets it to the correct value, ensuring the right message is displayed on the footer.

Scenario 3: Validate the type of the returned object from the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the footer_card function returns an object of type 'ui.footer_card'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check if the type of the returned object is 'ui.footer_card'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the footer_card function returns an object of the correct type, ensuring compatibility with other parts of the h2o_wave library that might use the returned object.
