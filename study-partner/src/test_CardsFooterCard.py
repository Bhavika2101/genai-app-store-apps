```python
Scenario 1: Testing the footer_card function for correct return type
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer_card function returns an object of the correct type, which should be a ui.footer_card object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed as the function does not require any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is of type ui.footer_card.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the function returns the correct type of object is essential for the function's correct operation within the greater codebase. If the function does not return a ui.footer_card object, it could lead to type errors or incorrect behavior in other parts of the program that use the returned object.

Scenario 2: Testing the footer_card function for correct caption
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer_card function returns a ui.footer_card object with the correct caption.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed as the function does not require any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function.
  Assert: Check that the returned object's caption attribute is "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave."
Validation:
  The caption of the footer_card is a crucial part of the user interface, as it communicates important information to the user. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the function sets the caption correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing the footer_card function for correct box attribute
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer_card function returns a ui.footer_card object with the correct box attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed as the function does not require any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function.
  Assert: Check that the returned object's box attribute is "footer".
Validation:
  The box attribute of the footer_card determines its position within the user interface. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the function sets the box attribute correctly to ensure that the footer card appears in the correct location.
