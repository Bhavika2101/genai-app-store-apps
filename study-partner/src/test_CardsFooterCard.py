Scenario 1: Validating the Box Parameter in the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_box_parameter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer card's box parameter is correctly set to "footer".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the box attribute of the returned footer_card object is set to "footer".
Validation:
  The box parameter is a crucial aspect of the footer card's layout. It is important to ensure that it is correctly set to "footer" as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Validating the Caption Parameter in the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_caption_parameter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the caption parameter of the footer card is correctly set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the caption attribute of the returned footer_card object is set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.".
Validation:
  The caption parameter is vital for displaying the appropriate message on the footer card. Ensuring that it is correctly set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave." is necessary according to the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Validating the Type of the Returned Object
Details:
  TestName: test_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function footer_card() returns an object of type ui.footer_card.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the returned object is of type ui.footer_card.
Validation:
  It's essential to confirm that the function returns an object of the correct type, as the type determines the properties and methods that are available for the returned object. This aligns with the function's specification of returning a footer_card object.

Scenario 4: Validating the Function with No Parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_no_parameters
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function footer_card() does not require any parameters to run successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the function runs successfully without any parameters.
Validation:
  It's crucial to ensure that the function operates as expected without any parameters, as per the function's specifications. This test ensures that the function is robust and can handle such situations.
