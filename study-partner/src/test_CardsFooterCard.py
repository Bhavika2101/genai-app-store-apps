Scenario 1: Validating the Box Parameter in the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_box_parameter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer card's box parameter is correctly set to "footer".

  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the box attribute of the returned footer_card object is set to "footer".

  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the caption attribute of the returned footer_card object is set to "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.".
Validation:
  The caption parameter is essential for providing information to the user. Ensuring it is correctly set guarantees the footer card will display the correct message.

Scenario 3: Validating the Type of the Footer Card
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the footer card is of the correct type, i.e., it should be an instance of ui.footer_card.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card().
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of ui.footer_card.
