Scenario 1: Validate the box value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'box' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'footer'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'box' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'footer'.
Validation:
  The box value in a footer card is important as it determines the location of the card in the layout. The expected value 'footer' is according to the function's specifications and thus needs to be validated.

Scenario 2: Validate the caption value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'caption' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check if the 'caption' attribute of the returned footer_card object is equal to 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Validation:
  The caption value in a footer card is important as it provides a message to the user. The expected value 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.' is according to the function's specifications and thus needs to be validated.

Scenario 3: Validate the type of object returned by the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function returns an object of type 'ui.footer_card'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check if the type of the returned object is 'ui.footer_card'.
Validation:
  The type of object returned by the function is critical as it determines the type of card that will be displayed on the UI. The expected type 'ui.footer_card' is according to the function's specifications and thus needs to be validated.
