Scenario 1: Test initialization of app for the first time
Details:
  TestName: test_app_initialization
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the application initializes properly when the initialize_app function is called for the first time. This includes loading the configuration from the toml file, uploading the loader files, setting the session count to 0, and setting up the h2ogpte instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Q object and the os environment variables for H2OGPTE_URL and H2OGPTE_API_TOKEN. Also, mock the toml.load, q.site.upload and H2OGPTE.list_recent_collections functions to return predefined values.
  Act: Call the initialize_app function with the mocked Q object.
  Assert: Check that the properties of the Q object's app property have been set correctly, and that the toml.load, q.site.upload and H2OGPTE.list_recent_collections functions have been called with the correct parameters.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the correct initialization of the app, which is crucial for the app's functioning. If the app is not initialized correctly, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors during the app's operation.

Scenario 2: Test that only collections with document count greater than 0 are added
Details:
  TestName: test_only_non_empty_collections_added
  Description: This test is intended to verify that only collections with a document count greater than 0 are added to the collections property of the app.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Q object, the os environment variables for H2OGPTE_URL and H2OGPTE_API_TOKEN, and the H2OGPTE.list_recent_collections function to return a list of collections with varying document counts.
  Act: Call the initialize_app function with the mocked Q object.
  Assert: Check that the collections property of the app only contains collections with a document count greater than 0.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the app correctly filters out empty collections, in line with the business requirement of only dealing with collections that contain documents.

Scenario 3: Test initialization when H2OGPTE_URL and H2OGPTE_API_TOKEN are not set
Details:
  TestName: test_initialization_without_h2ogpte_credentials
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the app can handle the case where the H2OGPTE_URL and H2OGPTE_API_TOKEN environment variables are not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Q object and the os environment variables for H2OGPTE_URL and H2OGPTE_API_TOKEN to return None. Also, mock the toml.load and q.site.upload functions to return predefined values.
  Act: Call the initialize_app function with the mocked Q object.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate error is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the app can handle missing configuration values gracefully, which is important for robustness and error handling.
