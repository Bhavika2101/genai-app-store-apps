```
Scenario 1: Validate the return of ui.footer_card method.
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_returns_correctly
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function footer_card returns the correct ui.footer_card object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card.
  Assert: Check whether the returned object is an instance of ui.footer_card and if the box and caption properties of the returned object match "footer" and "Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave." respectively.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the footer_card function is returning the correct ui.footer_card object with the correct properties. This is a fundamental requirement of the business logic encapsulated by the function.

Scenario 2: Validate the immutability of the return of ui.footer_card method.
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_is_immutable
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the returned ui.footer_card object cannot be modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card and attempt to modify the box or caption property of the returned object.
  Assert: Check whether an exception is thrown when trying to modify the returned object.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the footer_card function returns an immutable ui.footer_card object. This is a requirement of the business logic encapsulated by the function to prevent unwanted changes to the footer information.

Scenario 3: Validate the uniqueness of the return of ui.footer_card method.
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_is_unique
  Description: This test is intended to verify that each invocation of the footer_card function returns a unique ui.footer_card object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the function footer_card twice and compare the returned objects.
  Assert: Check whether the two returned objects are not the same.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the footer_card function always returns a unique ui.footer_card object. This is a requirement of the business logic encapsulated by the function to ensure that each footer card is unique.
