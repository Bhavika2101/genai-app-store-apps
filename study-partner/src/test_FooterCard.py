Scenario 1: Validate the box value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_box_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'box' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'footer'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check the 'box' value of the returned footer_card object. It should be 'footer'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'box' value is a crucial part of the footer_card function. It determines the placement of the footer card on the page. Thus, it's important to ensure the function returns the correct box value.

Scenario 2: Validate the caption value in the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_caption_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the 'caption' value of the footer card returned by the function is 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned footer_card object.
  Assert: Check the 'caption' value of the returned footer_card object. It should be 'Made with ðŸ’› and H2O Wave.'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The 'caption' value is an important part of the footer card. It gives information about the creation of the application. Thus, ensuring the function returns the correct caption is vital.

Scenario 3: Validate the type of the returned object from the footer_card function
Details:
  TestName: test_footer_card_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the footer_card function returns an object of type 'ui.footer_card'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no parameters are passed to the function.
  Act: Invoke the footer_card function and store the returned object.
  Assert: Check the type of the returned object. It should be 'ui.footer_card'.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The footer_card function should return an object of type 'ui.footer_card'. This test ensures that the function is behaving as expected and returning the correct object type.
