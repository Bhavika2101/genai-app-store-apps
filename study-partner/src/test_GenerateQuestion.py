Scenario 1: Test for question generation with a valid topic
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_question_with_valid_topic
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly generates a question when a valid topic is present in the arguments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with a valid topic in args and a topics_table.
  Act: Invoke the generate_question function with the initialized Q object.
  Assert: Check if the question is generated successfully, and the chatbot data and chat length are updated correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function works as expected when a valid topic is provided. This is crucial for the function's primary operation as it is supposed to generate questions based on the provided topic.

Scenario 2: Test for question generation with no topic
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_question_with_no_topic
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when no topic is provided in the arguments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object without a topic in args.
  Act: Invoke the generate_question function with the initialized Q object.
  Assert: Check if the function does not fail and handles the absence of a topic gracefully.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle cases where no topic is provided. This is important for robustness and reliability of the function.

Scenario 3: Test for question generation with multiple topics
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_question_with_multiple_topics
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles the case where multiple topics are present in the topics_table.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with multiple topics in the topics_table.
  Act: Invoke the generate_question function with the initialized Q object.
  Assert: Check if the function generates a question correctly and the chatbot data and chat length are updated correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle multiple topics, which is important for its versatility and usefulness in a real-world application.

Scenario 4: Test for question generation response
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_question_response
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly processes the response from the run function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Q object with a valid topic and mock the run function to return a specific response.
  Act: Invoke the generate_question function with the initialized Q object.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly parses the response and updates the chatbot data and last_question correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle and process the responses from the run function. This is crucial for the function's correct operation and for providing meaningful questions to the user.
