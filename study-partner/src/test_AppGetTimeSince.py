================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The code does not seem to validate or sanitize inputs that it receives. This can lead to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), where an attacker can manipulate inputs to gain access to unauthorized data.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize your inputs. Use Python's built-in features or third-party libraries to ensure that inputs are as expected and safe before using them.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling
Issue: The code does not seem to have proper error handling. This can lead to unexpected crashes, or worse, leaking of sensitive information when an error occurs.
Solution: Always use try/except blocks to catch and handle exceptions properly. Don't reveal sensitive information in error messages.

Vulnerability: Missing Authentication
Issue: The code does not seem to have any authentication mechanism. This can allow unauthorized users to access and potentially manipulate data.
Solution: Always implement proper authentication mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users.

Vulnerability: Missing Authorization
Issue: The code does not seem to have any authorization checks. This means once authenticated, a user can perform any action, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Always implement proper authorization checks to ensure that an authenticated user can only perform actions they are allowed to.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one year ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_year
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one year ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one year before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Years Ago'. The output of the function will be checked against this expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the correct calculation and formatting for a common scenario. The expected result '1 Years Ago' is in line with the function's specification to return the time difference in the format of 'X Years Ago'.

Scenario 2: Testing for a timestamp that is less than a minute ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_less_than_minute
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is less than a minute ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is less than a minute before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 'X Seconds Ago' where X is the actual seconds difference. The output of the function will be checked against this expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the correct calculation and formatting for a common scenario. The expected result 'X Seconds Ago' is in line with the function's specification to return the time difference in the format of 'X Seconds Ago'.

Scenario 3: Testing for a timestamp from the future
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_future_timestamp
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function handles a timestamp that is from the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is a few minutes ahead of the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: As the function is not specified to handle future timestamps, the expected behavior is not defined. This test will check if an exception is raised or if a negative time difference is returned.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks how the function handles unexpected input. The specifications do not define how to handle future timestamps, so this test will provide insight into the function's robustness and error handling.

Scenario 4: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one month ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_month
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one month ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one month before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Months Ago'. The output of the function will be checked against this expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the correct calculation and formatting for a common scenario. The expected result '1 Months Ago' is in line with the function's specification to return the time difference in the format of 'X Months Ago'.

Scenario 5: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one day ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_day
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one day ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one day before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Days Ago'. The output of the function will be checked against this expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the correct calculation and formatting for a common scenario. The expected result '1 Days Ago' is in line with the function's specification to return the time difference in the format of 'X Days Ago'.
