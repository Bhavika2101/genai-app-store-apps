Scenario 1: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one year ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_year
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one year ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one year before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Years Ago'. This will be checked by comparing the returned string with the expected string.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks if the function can handle and correctly calculate yearly differences.

Scenario 2: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one month ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_month
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one month ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one month before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Months Ago'. This will be checked by comparing the returned string with the expected string.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function can handle and correctly calculate monthly differences.

Scenario 3: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one day ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_day
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one day ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one day before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Days Ago'. This will be checked by comparing the returned string with the expected string.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function can handle and correctly calculate daily differences.

Scenario 4: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one hour ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_hour
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one hour ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one hour before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Hours Ago'. This will be checked by comparing the returned string with the expected string.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function can handle and correctly calculate hourly differences.

Scenario 5: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one minute ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_minute
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one minute ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one minute before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Minutes Ago'. This will be checked by comparing the returned string with the expected string.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function can handle and correctly calculate minutely differences.

Scenario 6: Testing for a timestamp that is exactly one second ago
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_one_second
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly calculates the time difference for a timestamp that is exactly one second ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one second before the current time.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is '1 Seconds Ago'. This will be checked by comparing the returned string with the expected string.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function can handle and correctly calculate differences in seconds.
  
Scenario 7: Testing for a timestamp that is in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_get_time_since_future_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles a timestamp that is in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: A timestamp will be created that is exactly one minute in the future.
  Act: The function get_time_since will be invoked with the created timestamp as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a negative duration, but the function should handle this edge case gracefully, possibly by returning a specific string or raising an error.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function can handle edge cases where the input timestamp is in the future.
