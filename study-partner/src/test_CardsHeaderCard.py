================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Format String (CWE-134)
Issue: The code template uses formatted strings for the 'title' and 'subtitle' fields in the 'header_card' function. If the 'q.app.toml' dictionary data is not properly validated or sanitized, it may lead to Format String vulnerabilities, which might allow a malicious user to read the stack, write to arbitrary memory locations, or execute arbitrary code.
Solution: Avoid using formatted strings with user-supplied input. If it's necessary, ensure that the 'q.app.toml' data is properly validated and sanitized before it's used in formatted strings.

Vulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)
Issue: The 'os.getenv' function is used to retrieve the 'LOGO' environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, a hard-coded URL is used as a fallback. If the 'LOGO' environment variable is used for storing sensitive data like cryptographic keys, it might pose a security risk as environment variables can be read by any process running in the same context.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive data in environment variables. If it's necessary, ensure that the environment variables are properly secured and can only be accessed by the required processes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with default logo
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_default_logo
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function can correctly generate a card with the default logo.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the environment variable "LOGO" to None.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that has a 'App' key in its toml attribute, containing 'Title' and 'Description' keys.
  Assert: Check that the returned card's image attribute matches the default logo URL.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where no logo is specified. In this case, it should use the default logo URL.

Scenario 2: Test with custom logo
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_custom_logo
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function can correctly generate a card with a custom logo.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the environment variable "LOGO" to a custom URL.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that has a 'App' key in its toml attribute, containing 'Title' and 'Description' keys.
  Assert: Check that the returned card's image attribute matches the custom logo URL.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where a custom logo is specified. In this case, it should use the custom logo URL.

Scenario 3: Test with custom title and description
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_custom_title_and_description
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function can correctly generate a card with a custom title and description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the environment variable "LOGO" to None.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that has a 'App' key in its toml attribute, containing 'Title' and 'Description' keys with custom values.
  Assert: Check that the returned card's title and subtitle attributes match the custom values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly pulls the title and description from the Q object's toml attribute and uses them to generate the card.

Scenario 4: Test with missing 'App' key in Q object's toml attribute
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_missing_app_key
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function throws an exception when the 'App' key is missing in the Q object's toml attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the environment variable "LOGO" to None.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that does not have a 'App' key in its toml attribute.
  Assert: Check that the function throws a KeyError.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the 'App' key is missing in the Q object's toml attribute. In this case, it should throw a KeyError, as this is a required key.

Scenario 5: Test with missing 'Title' and 'Description' keys in Q object's toml attribute
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_missing_title_and_description_keys
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function throws an exception when the 'Title' and 'Description' keys are missing in the Q object's toml attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the environment variable "LOGO" to None.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that has a 'App' key in its toml attribute, but missing 'Title' and 'Description' keys.
  Assert: Check that the function throws a KeyError.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the 'Title' and 'Description' keys are missing in the Q object's toml attribute. In this case, it should throw a KeyError, as these are required keys.
