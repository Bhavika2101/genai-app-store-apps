Scenario 1: Test with default logo
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_default_logo
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function can correctly generate a card with the default logo.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Q object with a toml dictionary containing 'App', 'Title', and 'Description'.
  Act: Invoke the header_card function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the result of the function is a card object with the default logo as the image.
Validation:
  The default logo is a critical fallback mechanism, ensuring that the card always has an image even if no LOGO environment variable is set. This test validates that functionality.

Scenario 2: Test with custom logo
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_custom_logo
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function can correctly generate a card with a custom logo when the LOGO environment variable is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Q object with a toml dictionary containing 'App', 'Title', and 'Description'. Set the LOGO environment variable to a custom URL.
  Act: Invoke the header_card function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the result of the function is a card object with the custom logo as the image.
Validation:
  The ability to set a custom logo is important for branding and customization purposes. This test validates that functionality.

Scenario 3: Test with missing 'App' in toml
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_missing_app_in_toml
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function raises an appropriate error when the 'App' key is missing in the toml dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Q object with a toml dictionary that does not contain 'App'.
  Act: Invoke the header_card function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a KeyError.
Validation:
  The 'App' key is necessary for the header_card function to run correctly. This test validates that the function fails as expected when 'App' is missing.

Scenario 4: Test with missing 'Title' or 'Description' in toml
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_missing_title_or_description_in_toml
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function raises an appropriate error when the 'Title' or 'Description' key is missing in the 'App' dictionary of the toml dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Q object with a toml dictionary containing 'App', but missing either 'Title' or 'Description'.
  Act: Invoke the header_card function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a KeyError.
Validation:
  Both 'Title' and 'Description' are necessary for the header_card function to run correctly. This test validates that the function fails as expected when either 'Title' or 'Description' is missing.

Scenario 5: Test with empty 'Title' or 'Description' in toml
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_with_empty_title_or_description_in_toml
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function can correctly generate a card with an empty title or description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Q object with a toml dictionary containing 'App', 'Title', and 'Description', where either 'Title' or 'Description' is an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the header_card function with the Q object.
  Assert: Check that the result of the function is a card object with an empty title or description.
Validation:
  It is valid for the 'Title' or 'Description' to be empty. This test validates that the function handles this case correctly.
