Scenario 1: Test with default logo URL
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_default_logo
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function correctly uses the default logo URL when the "LOGO" environment variable is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Remove the "LOGO" environment variable if it exists.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that has the required 'App' values in its 'toml' attribute.
  Assert: Check that the returned card has the expected title, subtitle, and default logo URL.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly falls back to the default logo URL when the "LOGO" environment variable is not set. This is important to ensure the application displays correctly in environments where the "LOGO" variable has not been configured.

Scenario 2: Test with custom logo URL
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_custom_logo
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function correctly uses a custom logo URL when the "LOGO" environment variable is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the "LOGO" environment variable to a custom URL.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that has the required 'App' values in its 'toml' attribute.
  Assert: Check that the returned card has the expected title, subtitle, and custom logo URL.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly uses a custom logo URL when the "LOGO" environment variable is set. This is important to allow customization of the application's appearance in different deployment environments.

Scenario 3: Test with missing 'App' values in Q object
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_missing_app_values
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function behaves as expected when the Q object does not contain the required 'App' values in its 'toml' attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that does not have the required 'App' values in its 'toml' attribute.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the case where the Q object does not contain the required 'App' values. This is important for robustness, as it prevents the function from failing in an uncontrolled manner when faced with incorrect input.

Scenario 4: Test with empty 'App' values in Q object
Details:
  TestName: test_header_card_empty_app_values
  Description: This test will verify that the header_card function behaves as expected when the Q object contains empty 'App' values in its 'toml' attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed.
  Act: Call the header_card function with a Q object that has empty 'App' values in its 'toml' attribute.
  Assert: Check that the returned card has an empty title and subtitle, and the default or custom logo URL.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the case where the Q object contains empty 'App' values. This is important for robustness, as it ensures that the function can handle a wider range of input conditions.
