Message from Group CEO, Mr Yuen Kuan Moon       'Underlying net profit grew  15%  in the first quarter despite prevailing  macroeconomic  challenges and currency headwinds. Our growth engines, NCS and Digital  InfraCo executed well, roaming recovery stayed strong across our consumer and enterprise  businesses, and we\u2019ve lowered net finance ex penses significantly with the proceeds from  our capital recycling initiatives\nSingapore Telecommunications Ltd And Subsidiary Companies                                       Page 3           REVIEW OF GROUP OPERATING PERFORMANCE     For The First  Quarter Ended 30  June  2023    The Group\u2019s  operating revenue and EBITDA in the first  quarter ended 30  June 2023  were   down 2.7%  and 7.7% respectively  with a 9% decline in the Australian  Dollar. On a  constant  currency basis, operating revenue  would have been up 2.5%, led by higher revenues from   its growth engines,  NCS  and Digital Infraco , while EBITDA would have been  down 3.1% on  inflationary cost pressures . With a reduction in depreciation and amortisation charges,  EBIT (before associates\u2019 contributions)  fell 7.1%.    Optus\u2019 operating revenue was up 1.1%  given the  challenging market conditions from  competitive pricing and a weak ening in consumer sentiment . Mobile service revenue grew   2.7%, with increases in  roaming and postpaid ARPU more than offsetting the decline in  handset insurance revenue following the sale of the insurance business in the June quarter   last year . Operating expenses rose due to high inflation and a spike in energy costs following  expiry of a  fixed price contract . As a result, EBITDA declined 5.5% .     In Singtel Singapore, operating revenue  fell 1.8% due to continued decline in legacy carriage   services and intense price competition in mobile amid a shift in the market to lower end plans.  The declines in international data, pay TV and voice were partly mitigated by higher mobile  service revenue . Postpaid revenue was boosted by  higher  roaming  as international travel  continued to recover . Prepaid revenue was stable as the increases  in the foreigner customer  base and data usage were offset  by lower prices  and IDD. Pay TV revenue was lower   following the  cessation of P remier League but  the impact was offset by lower content cost.  EBITDA was stable as a result of cost management .      NCS \u2019 operating revenue increased 14% driven by a full quarter  of contributions from  subsidiaries acquired last year  as well as  growth in Enterprise and Telco businesses\n\nQuestion: what is first quarter operating revenue?\nAnswer:",
