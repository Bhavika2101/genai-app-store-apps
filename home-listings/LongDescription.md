# Use AI to Write your Home Listing

The **Make Your Own Home Listing** app is a custom UI on top of LLMs for a special use case.

Any data scientist or Python developer could build a similar app using open source H2O Wave and H2OGPT!

Real Estate agents and those wishing to sell their home can use this app to automatically generate a
real estate listing based on details about the home.

Ways that Python developers could easily customize this app:
* Change details and attributes about your home in the input form
* Edit the text of the prompt in the textbox to add more custom details about your home
* Change the complete use case - this template could become an app which helps you draft emails
