Scenario 1: Verify the addition of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_num_positive_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers, such as 5 and 3.
  Act: Invoke the add_num function with these integers as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 8, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to 8.
Validation:
  It is important to verify that the function can correctly add two positive integers, as this is a common use case and a basic requirement for any addition function.

Scenario 2: Verify the addition of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_num_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers, such as -5 and -3.
  Act: Invoke the add_num function with these integers as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is -8, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to -8.
Validation:
  It is important to verify that the function can correctly add two negative integers, as this is an essential feature of any addition function.

Scenario 3: Verify the addition of a positive and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_add_num_positive_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and a negative integer, such as 5 and -3.
  Act: Invoke the add_num function with these integers as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 2, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to 2.
Validation:
  It is important to verify that the function can correctly add a positive integer and a negative integer, as this is an essential feature of any addition function.

Scenario 4: Verify the addition of two floating point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_num_floats
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating point numbers, such as 3.5 and 1.2.
  Act: Invoke the add_num function with these numbers as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 4.7, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to 4.7.
Validation:
  It is important to verify that the function can correctly add two floating point numbers, as this is a common use case for any addition function.

Scenario 5: Verify the addition of zero and a number
Details:
  TestName: test_add_num_zero_and_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add zero and a number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a number, such as 0 and 5.
  Act: Invoke the add_num function with these numbers as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 5, which will be checked by comparing the function's return value to 5.
Validation:
  It is important to verify that the function can correctly add zero and a number, as this is a fundamental requirement for any addition function, and it's also a good way to test the function's handling of zero.
